Are men really more quotable than women?
What is the most represented nationality of speakers?
What are the characteristics of speakers across topics?
Is there a time evolution in the age, gender and nationality of the speakers?</em></p>

<p>We have asked all these questions and we will try to answer them in our data story.</p>

<h2 id="motivation"><strong>Motivation</strong></h2>
<p>Whether we are aware of it or not, we are all assigned multiple social identities. Over the last few years, many revolutionary movements have become more and more important in our society regarding gender equality, racism or even overall discrimination against groups. Is this evolution reflected in the press ?</p>

<p>We will analyse the stakes of this question based on the Quotebank dataset. Indeed, we can regroup the main different topics appearing in the press and find the social and cultural background of the most influential speakers that are quoted for each topic. This would underline which characteristics of the speaker the press considers to have the most chance to attract readers. Therefore, the possible evolution from 2015 until 2020 of the above findings can reveal the progression of our society regarding the representation of all cultural, social or gender identities through the voice they are given across different press sources.</p>

<h2 id="methods"><strong>Methods</strong></h2>

<h2 id="data-analysis"><strong>Data analysis</strong></h2>

<p>So we have a dataset of labelled quotations broken down into 5 categories - business, entertainment, sports, tech and politics, for each year from 2015 to 2020 across different news sources.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at our analysis!</p>

<h3 id="proportion-of-topics"><strong>Proportion of topics</strong></h3>

<p>First of all, we can look at the distribution of the topics of quotations across years. 
Here in the figures 0 label denotes business, 1 - entertainment, 2 - politics, 3 - sport and 4 - tech.</p>

<p><img src="/images/distribution_of_label.png" alt="distribution_of_label" /></p>

<p>As we can see, the distribution of topics is quite similar across the years. The most talked topic is sport (except 2020, where the most discussed subject is business) and the less talked is politics.
As the distribition of topics is similar for each year, the analysis of the type of speakers among the years will be representative as the labels have a comparable number of data.</p>

<p>Visualization using pie charts for each year confirms our observations.</p>

<p><img src="/images/proportion_of_each_label_for_year_2020.png" alt="proportion_of_each_label_for_year_2020" /></p>

<h3 id="time-evolution-of-topics"><strong>Time evolution of topics</strong></h3>

<p>Let’s analyze the evolution of topics over time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/evolution_of_labels_in_function_of_time_for_all_the_years.png" alt="evolution_of_labels_in_function_of_time_for_all_the_years" /></p>

<p>For all topics, the evolution in times of number of quotations is mainly oscillatory with the same phase and period (but not the same amplitude). Therefore, there is no distinct evolution trend in time across topics</p>

<p>To continue the analysis, the proportion of duplicated speakers and the proportion of duplicated speakers associated with different topics were calculated.</p>

<p>Now we can perform analysis of speakers by age, gender and nationality across the topics.</p>

<h3 id="age-analysis"><strong>Age Analysis</strong></h3>

<p>We start from age analysis. In order to analyze the age of the different speakers, we will work using their birth date. This allows to compare the age of the speakers across datasets created based on content of different years (2015 to 2020).</p>

<h4 id="overall-age-distribition"><strong>Overall age distribition</strong></h4>

<p>To begin with, we will filter out from the dataset speakers born before the 100. This data is 0.2% or less of the dataset of each year. These dataset rows look extremely unlikely, so we get rid of them in order to perform a correct analysis of the date of birth of the other speakers.</p>

<p>We can firstly visualize the overall age distribution of the speakers for all the years.</p>

<p><img src="/images/distributions_of_date_of_birth_of_the_speakers.png" alt="distributions_of_date_of_birth_of_the_speakers" /></p>

<p>Despite the fact that the data still has outliers, we decided to keep them. Since we are investigating the age groups of speakers across different topics, it is important for us to keep the extreme values of age.</p>

<p>The effect of outliers on the mean date of birth can be seen by comparing the mean and the median (the median is not sensitive to outliers).</p>

<p>We observe that for each dataset the mean and the median are comparable (the difference is less than one year). Therefore, studying the evolution of mean date of birth over time for further analysis will get interpretable results. The overall mean of date of birth is around 1967.87, that is speakers aged 53 years old nowdays.</p>

<h4 id="age-distribution-per-topics"><strong>Age distribution per topics</strong></h4>

<p>To understand the distribution of the speaker’s date of birth per topic, we will split the date of birth into categories 0-1900, 1901-1920, 1921-1940, 1941-1960, 1961-1980, 1981-2000, 2001-2020.
Speakers with a date of birth before 1900 make up an extremely insignificant part of the data, but those born in the 20th and 21st century represent the bulk of the dataset. Therefore, we have divided the 20th and 21st centuries into categories of 20 years.</p>

<p>We can plot the number of speakers per category of date of birth for all the years merged. Here in the figures 0 label denotes business, 1 - entertainment, 2 - politics, 3 - sport and 4 - tech.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dist_count_date_of_birth_category.png" alt="dist_count_date_of_birth_category" /></p>

<p>Also we can plot the distribution of topics for each date of birth category.</p>

<p><img src="/images/distribution_of_topics_for_each_date_of_birth_category.png" alt="distribution_of_topics_for_each_date_of_birth_category" /></p>

<p>As we can see from the distributions plots above, the age category of speakers born after 2000 is completly underrespresented for all topics. Regarding the topic business, the main represented speakers are borned bewteen 1940 and 1980, as well as for the politic topic. For entertainment, sport and technology topics, younger speakers borned bewtenn 1980 and 2000 are more represented. Those results are expected because press consideres topics considered topics such as business and politics as more ‘serious’ and therefore quote more aged and experienced. This can be due to the fact that the press source wants to be seen by the public as realable and truthfull. However, younger persons should be given a voice in press as they represent the future of our society. Does this change of state of mind apears between 2015 and 2020? To respond to this question, an analysis of the time evolution of age of speakers is performed.</p>

<h4 id="time-evolution-of-age-of-speakers"><strong>Time evolution of age of speakers</strong></h4>

<p><img src="/images/evolution_over_time_of_date_of_birth_category_per_topics.png" alt="evolution_over_time_of_date_of_birth_category_per_topics" /></p>

<p>As we can see from the plots, thi histograms for each topic have approximately the same shape and, therefore, we don’t observe any significant difference among topics for the age of the most represented catogory of age speakers.
For all topics the speakers born in 1940-1980 are overrepresented and the speakers born after 2000 are underrepresented.
Indeed, young speakers may not be seen as truthworthy by the press due to their very young age. Those type of speakers are more quoted for entertainment topics, highlighting the fact that young speakers are quoted about more light subject that buisness and politics for example. However, they are a little bit more quoted about technology. Indeed, technology is an emerging topic nowdays that young persons tend to be interested in.</p>

<p>To confirm the hypothesis that the overall speakers age do not change over time, let’s analyze the evolution of the mean age of speakers from 2015 to 2020 in the press and plot the evolution of mean date of birth in function of time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/mean_date_of_birth_in_function_of_time.png" alt="mean_date_of_birth_in_function_of_time" /></p>

<p>We can see that the mean age of speaker is the highest in 2019 and the lowest in 2015. But is this difference statistically significant? To verify this hypothesis, we will use a p-test, from which we observe p &lt; 0.5.
We can deduct that the difference between the two scenarios are statistically significant so the hypothesis that the difference between the two scenarios is zero is rejected. However, when performing a p-test on very large sample size, the computation of the p-value will nearly always be under 0.05. This result can not be interpreted as an absolute truth. Moreover, the visualization of the plot of the evolution of mean date in function of time is interpolated with a line of a slope of only 0.3. Those clues allow us to say that the evolution of mean age per time is insignificant. We can conclude that speakers aged between 41 and 56 years old are overrespresented and younger speakers are underrepresented in the english speaking press from 2015 to 2020 based on all the analysis performed on our datasets.</p>

<h3 id="gender-analysis"><strong>Gender Analysis</strong></h3>

<p>Let’s move on to the analysis of gender.</p>

<p>Since we are more interested in the possible discrimination between genders that the actual gender identity of the speakers, we can regroup some of the genders. For example females with cisgender females, males with cisgender males and other gender identities as genderqueer.</p>

<h4 id="gender-distribution-per-topic"><strong>Gender distribution per topic</strong></h4>

<p>We will first have a look at the gender distribution per topic for all years from 2015 to 2020. We plot distribution of gender per topics in 2 formats - as histograms and as pie charts.</p>

<p><img src="/images/histograms_of_gender_per_topics_for_year_2015_to_2020.png" alt="histograms_of_gender_per_topics_for_year_2015_to_2020" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/proportion_of_gender_per_topics_for_year_2015_to_2020.png" alt="proportion_of_gender_per_topics_for_year_2015_to_2020" /></p>

<p>We can observe that  that men are always more represented than women across all topics, especially in the topics of sports and tech. 
Other gender identities are also poorly represented, which can be because of these people represent in general a smaller portion of the population.</p>
